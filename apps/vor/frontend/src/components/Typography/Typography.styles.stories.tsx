    It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss
    of virginity is rational increase, and there was never virgin got till
    virginity was first lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins.
    Virginity by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever kept is
    ever lost. Tis too cold a companion.
